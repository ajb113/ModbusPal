# ModbusPal v1.6a - beta release

> NOTE: The project was forked from the abandoned SourceForge repository [found here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/modbuspal/). The commit history was preserved (using git-svn conversion) and was modified to be a proper Maven project. Currently Modbus TCP has been tested and verified that it works correctly. Time permitted we plan to improve it, cause a proper OSS Modbus simulator is currently missing. 
 
This release of ModbusPal v1.6a is a release candidate version.

Known limitations:
- "Tuning" features are not documented yet
- "Chart" feature is not documented yet
- Javadoc very incomplete
